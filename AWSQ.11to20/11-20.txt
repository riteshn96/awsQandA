#AWS Questions 11 to 20

11. What are differnet instance types and their uses?
A.  General Purpose (T, M families): Balanced CPU, memory & networking used for	Web servers, small databases, app hosting
    Compute Optimized (C family): High-performance CPUs used for High-traffic web servers, gaming, ML inference
    Memory Optimized (R, X, Z families): High RAM for large datasets used for In-memory databases (Redis, SAP HANA), real-    time big data analytics.
    Storage Optimized (I, D, H families): Fast local storage (SSD/HDD) used for Big data, databases, data warehouse.
    Accelerated Computing (P, G, F families): GPUs & FPGAs for parallel workloads used for Machine learning, AI, video
    rendering, scientific computing.

12. How is an EC2 instance connected?
A.  An EC2 instance can be connected via SSh(linux) or Remote Desktop Protocol(RDP){Windows}

13. How is costing in EC2 instance?
A.  Costing in EC2 depends on instance type, region, billing model, storage etc.

14. How many types of instances are based on availability and what are the types?
A.  Short-term, flexible workloads? → On-Demand
    Long-running applications? → Reserved Instances (RI)
    Non-critical, fault-tolerant tasks? → Spot Instances
    Need full hardware control? → Dedicated Hosts
    Security-sensitive applications? → Dedicated Instances
    Critical apps needing guaranteed capacity? → Capacity Reservations

15. What ios public IP and private IP and its uses?
A.  A Public IP is an Internet-facing address assigned to an EC2 instance, allowing it to communicate outside AWS.
    Uses:  Accessing EC2 instances from the internet (e.g., SSH, RDP).
    Hosting websites, APIs, or public-facing applications.
    Allowing users to interact with a service hosted on EC2.
    A Private IP is used for internal communication within an AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud).
    Uses: Connecting EC2 instances within the same VPC (private networking).
    Internal database access (e.g., RDS, NoSQL, or custom servers).
    Running multi-tier applications where backend servers should not be exposed to the internet.

16. How can we make public IP to static?
A.  By default, AWS assigns dynamic public IPs to EC2 instances, meaning the IP changes every time the instance is stopped    and restarted. To make a public IP static, you need to use an Elastic IP (EIP).
    Steps: Allocate an Elastic IP, Associate the Elastic IP with an EC2 Instance, Verify the elastic IP assignment.

17. How can we connect EC2 instance to internet?
A.  Steps: Assing a public IP address, Attach an Internet Gateway, Update Route table to allow internet traffic, configure    security group.

18. What is elastic  IP and its uses?
A.  An Elastic IP (EIP) in AWS is a static, public IPv4 address that can be assigned to an EC2 instance. Unlike a regular     public IP, which changes when an instance is restarted, an Elastic IP remains the same until manually released.
    Uses: Hosting Websites & APIs, Failover & High Availability, VPN & Remote Access, Load Balancer Alternative,
    Reverse Proxy & Firewall Rules

19. Difference between vcpu and cpu and its uses?
A.  A vCPU (virtual CPU) is a portion of a physical CPU core allocated to a virtual machine (VM) like an AWS EC2 instance.
    vCPUs allow scalable cloud computing without dedicated physical servers.
    Used in AI, gaming, web hosting, video processing, and HPC.
    AWS Auto Scaling & containerized apps rely on vCPU-based performance.
    vCPUs are allocated based on EC2 instance types (e.g., c5, m6g, p4d).

20. What is EC2 hibernate and its advantages?
A.  EC2 Hibernate is a feature that allows you to pause and resume an EC2 instance while preserving the in-memory (RAM)
    state. Unlike stopping an instance (which clears memory), hibernation saves the RAM contents to disk (EBS) and
    restores it when the instance is restarted.
    It’s similar to hibernation mode in laptops, where you can shut down and resume without losing open applications.
    Uses: Faster Startup Time, Saves Running Costs, Preserves Application State, Ideal for Long-Running Workloads,
    Security & Encryption.
